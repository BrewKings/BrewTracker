# BrewTracker
Android app for tracking small batch brewing.

This is a personal project I decided to make to help track my own batches of mead. I had this idea on the bus one dayand thought, "I wish I had an app that I could use to track my batches of mead..." Then I realized, "Wait...I can make an app to track my batches of mead!" And thus, the BrewTracker was born.

This project is currently in the planning stages and has little to no progress, however, I hope to work on this as much as I can in my free time.
